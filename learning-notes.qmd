# My Learning Notes – How I Learn Smarter, Not Just Harder

During my journey studying **Applied Artificial Intelligence**, I've discovered that **how** you learn matters just as much as **what** you learn.

Taking notes isn't just about recording what the lecturer says—it’s about **actively processing information**, making connections, and revisiting the material strategically.

##️ How I Take Notes

I organize my learning notes in three stages:

- **Quick Capture** (During lecture):
  - Focus on core concepts, diagrams, and keywords.
  - Use shorthand and symbols to move fast.
- **Refinement** (After class):
  - Rewrite and restructure the notes in my own words.
  - Add mind maps or flowcharts for complex processes.
- **Review & Spaced Repetition**:
  - Use tools like Notion and Anki to schedule short review sessions.
  - I try to teach the concept to a friend—if I can teach it, I know it.

## Tools That Work for Me

- `Notion` for syncing class notes and assignments  
- `Obsidian` for graph-based note linking  
- `Anki` for flashcards (especially helpful in ML algorithms)

## How It Helped

- Better grades with less cramming
- More confidence discussing technical topics
- Faster understanding in team projects and internships

This quote reminds me to **always write things down**, especially during fast-paced AI and programming modules.
