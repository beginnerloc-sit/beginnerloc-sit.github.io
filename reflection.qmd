## GenAI Tool I Used

For this assessment, I used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) by OpenAI.

I chose ChatGPT because:

- It responds quickly with contextual and relevant content
- It supports Markdown, code, and web technologies like CSS
- I am paying S$25 subscription for the Pro version, which is worth it for my needs

---

## How ChatGPT Helped Me

Here’s how ChatGPT supported me throughout the project:

### Writing and Structuring

- Helped me to revise the syntax for Markdown and Quarto blocks to follow best practices
- Assisted in drafting this reflection content

### Styling with CSS

ChatGPT generated a responsive and aesthetic `styles.css` file that:

- Aligned profile and project content properly
- Made the site mobile-friendly
- Matched a dark theme I personally prefer

> It saved me from having to look up dozens of CSS layout issues.

## Benefits of Using GenAI

- Saves time and reduces stress
- Helps when I'm stuck and don't know how to begin
- Offers inspiration and variations that improve creativity

> “The tool is like a pair programmer and writing coach combined.”

---

## Challenges I Faced

- It sometimes produces overly complex examples I had to simplify
- The suggestions depend heavily on how well I phrased my questions
- I still needed to test and fine-tune the results manually

## How I Might Use GenAI in the Future

I believe GenAI tools will assist me by:

- Explaining tough concepts during revision
- Helping debug code faster during assignments
- Acting as a support system in both solo and group projects

## Learning Resources

I also learned the basics of Quarto from the following video:
