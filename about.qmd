# AI Vision Safety Monitoring System 👷‍♂️📹

This is an end-to-end system that leverages **AI Vision** to monitor **safety compliance** and **attendance** at construction sites.  
Its goal is to enhance worksite safety and efficiency through automation.

:::{.project-description}

The system integrates computer vision models with real-time camera feeds to:

- Detect **PPE violations** (e.g., missing helmet or vest)
- Track **on-site personnel attendance**
- **Capture abnormalities** and instantly **alert supervisors** through a monitoring dashboard

When any rule violation or dangerous behavior is detected, the system will:

1. **Capture a snapshot**
2. **Flag the event**
3. **Send an alert** to the central dashboard for human response
